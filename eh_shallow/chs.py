"""Composite Hazard Score (CHS) and Habitable Area Fraction (HAF).

Implements the hardened metric from EH_shallow.tex on a REAL 0.5-degree grid
(see `grid.py`) with the proposal's *tiered* disaggregation:

  - each variable is *oriented* so larger = more hazard, then standardised using
    the PREINDUSTRIAL baseline (1750-1800) mean (full-period scale -- see the
    `_standardise` note);
  - tier (i): surface-temperature-driven variables are pattern-scaled onto the
    present-day land warming pattern; tier (iii): variables with no defensible
    land field are spatially-uniform modifiers (tier (ii), the locally-forced
    vars, needs the gridded WHI stack and is not yet wired in);
  - CHS(cell, t) = P_temp(cell)*sT(t) + B(cell) + U(t), with sT the tier-(i)
    driver, U the tier-(iii) uniform sum, and B the present-day baseline field;
  - HAF = area-weighted fraction of LAND with CHS below a reference level tau
    (90th percentile of the preindustrial CHS distribution ~ percentile of B).
    We also report a SMOOTH exceedance and the sensitivity to the percentile,
    per the proposal's fix to the "threshold-free" overclaim.
